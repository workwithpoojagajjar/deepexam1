Que1: Using Keras's Functional API, write the code for a convolutional neural network corresponding to the following information: the network uses the 'Conv/Con/Max Pooling' block pattern, contains 3 blocks, the number of
filters follows a [ 32, 256, 512) pattern from block to block, and the classifier portion has 1 layer(s) with activation(s) = ReLU, and [128] neurons, respectively. The output layer has 3 neuron(s) and should have an activation
suitable to a classification problem. All convolutional layers have activation - ReLU, filter size = (3, 3) and padding - valid, while the pooling layers have a window of size - (3, 3); both types of layers have typical values for
the stride. The input data has shape = (32, 32, 1). All hyperparameters noted in the question should be included explicitly in your code. Your code only needs to create the model, that is, no imports, no data, no compile.
no fit.

Answer1:

from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Input layer
input_layer = Input(shape=(32, 32, 1))

# Block 1
x = Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', padding='valid', strides=(1, 1))(input_layer)
x = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(3, 3), strides=(2, 2))(x)

# Block 2
x = Conv2D(filters=256, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', padding='valid', strides=(1, 1))(x)
x = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(3, 3), strides=(2, 2))(x)

# Block 3
x = Conv2D(filters=512, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', padding='valid', strides=(1, 1))(x)
x = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(3, 3), strides=(2, 2))(x)

# Flatten and classifier portion
x = Flatten()(x)
x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)

# Output layer for a classification problem with 3 classes
output_layer = Dense(3, activation='softmax')(x)

# Create the model
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)


Que2: For the input array x = p.array([[ 6, 2, 9, 5, 2, 7), [10, 0, 1, 6, 10, 8], [ 2, 9, 0, 0, 10, 8), [ 3, 2, 2, 7, 0, 3], [10, 9, 4, 1, 6, 6], [10, 7, 8, 7, 4, 10]]), filter f = p.array/(-1, -1, 11, [ 3, -2, 01. (-1, 0, -31), padding = valid, and strides = 1,

Que3: You have imported a pretrained model as ResNet50. This pretrained model only contains the convolution portion, and its final layer is a average pooling layer. Using Keras's functional API, create a model that uses this pretrained model and has a classifier with one hidden layer with 64 neurons with activation sigmoid and an output layer with 10 neurons and an activation suitable for classification. There should be a layer that assures that the pixel values processed by the network have values in the range 0 to 1. The network should be able to process images with dimensions (32, 32, 3). (No preprocessing layer is required.)

Ans3: 
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Rescaling, Dense, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50

# Input layer
input_layer = Input(shape=(32, 32, 3))

# Rescaling layer to ensure pixel values are in the range [0, 1]
x = Rescaling(scale=1.0 / 255)(input_layer)

# Load the pretrained ResNet50 model (only the convolution portion, excluding the top classifier layers)
# We set include_top=False to exclude the fully connected layers
# Set pooling to 'avg' to add a global average pooling layer at the end of the ResNet model
pretrained_model = ResNet50(include_top=False, pooling='avg', input_shape=(32, 32, 3))
x = pretrained_model(x)

# Flattening layer is not needed as pooling='avg' outputs a 1D tensor

# Classifier portion
x = Dense(64, activation='sigmoid')(x)
output_layer = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

# Create the final model
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

﻿﻿use a dataset that is different from your original dataset so your model can learn better patterns

Que11: You have imported the convolution portion of a pretrained model and its layers are stored as model=[Layer('Conv2D_block_1'), Layer ('Conv2D_block_1'), Layer(MaxPooling_block_1'), Layer('Conv2D _block _2).
Layer(ConvD _block_2'), Layer("MaxPooling_block_2"), Layer('Conv2D_block_3'), Layer('Conv2D_block_3'), Layer(MaxPooling_block _3'), Layer('Conv2D _block_4"), Layer('Conv2D_block 4", Layer(MaxPooling block_4),
Layer(Conv2D_block_5'), Layer('Conv2D_block_5'), Layer(MaxPooling block_5'), Layer(Conv2D_block_6), Layer('Conv2D_block_6), Layer(MaxPooling_block _6')]. Write code that will make only the layers in the last block trainable. (See provided class definition for Layer.)

Ans11: # Assuming model is a list of layers as described
class Layer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.trainable = True  # Default is trainable

# Example model definition
model = [
    Layer('Conv2D_block_1'), Layer('Conv2D_block_1'), Layer('MaxPooling_block_1'),
    Layer('Conv2D_block_2'), Layer('Conv2D_block_2'), Layer('MaxPooling_block_2'),

]

# Determine the layers in the last block
last_block_start_index = len(model) - 6  # Assuming each block has 3 layers (Conv2D, Conv2D, MaxPooling)
last_block_layers = model[last_block_start_index:]

# Set all layers in the model to non-trainable
for layer in model:
    layer.trainable = False

# Set only the layers in the last block to trainable
for layer in last_block_layers:
    layer.trainable = True

# Output the trainable status of each layer for verification
for layer in model:
    print(f'Layer: {layer.name}, Trainable: {layer.trainable}')


Explanation:
Layer Class: A simple class to represent layers with a name and a trainable attribute.
Model Definition: A list of layers representing the structure of the pretrained model.
Last Block Identification: The code identifies the last block by slicing the model list.
Trainability Setting: It first sets all layers to trainable = False, and then sets the layers in the last block to trainable = True.
Verification: The code prints the trainable status of each layer for confirmation.
