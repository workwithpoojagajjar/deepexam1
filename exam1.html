1. Draw and label a single neuron and then calculate the output of neuron using the following information:
X =
[4,2,âˆ’1,2]
 
W =
[1,0,2,1]
 
b = [-4]
sigmoid activation function

ANS1: Here's the diagram of a single neuron, as requested. Now, let's calculate the output of the neuron using the provided values.

The formula for a neuron's output is:

Z = (W_1 X_1 + W_2 X_2 + W_3 X_3 + W_4 X_4) + b


where:
( X = [4, 2, -1, 2] \)
( W = [1, 0, 2, 1] \)
( b = -4 \)

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. Compute the weighted sum:

Z = (1 \times 4) + (0 \times 2) + (2 \times -1) + (1 \times 2) - 4

Z = 4 + 0 - 2 + 2 - 4

Z = 0

2. Apply the sigmoid activation function:

sigma(Z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-Z}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{0}} = \frac{1}{2}


The output of the neuron is **0.5**.
